# AI_Recognition_Program

The python program detects the age (in 20 years intervals), the gender and the emotion (7 different emotions) of the person in front of the laptop camera.

The ".pdf" and ".docx" files contains the master thesis connected to this program. The ".jpynb" files contain the training of the neural networks for the emotion, age and gender and the corresponding ".keras" files are the trained models. The paths for the trained data can be seen in the jupter files and the links to the dataset can be seen in the textfiles and in the master thesis. The main program that connects to the laptops camera is called "main.py", which you can run with "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" and the three ".keras" files (python main.py).
